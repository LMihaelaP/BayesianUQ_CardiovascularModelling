# BayesianUQ_CardiovascularModelling
Data sets and software for Bayesian uncertainty quantification in a fluid-dynamics model for the paper 'MCMC with Gaussian Processes for fast parameter estimation and 
uncertainty quantification in a 1D fluid-dynamics model of the pulmonary circulation' by L. Mihaela Paun and Dirk Husmeier (accepted for publication in IJNMBE).

The emulation MCMC algorithms can be found in folders: AHMC, ARMHMC, ALDMC, NUTS, and the conventional MCMC (based on AM) can be found in SimulatorAM. 
The main scripts within every folder start with PaperCode_*.
